# Intro to JavaScript

JavaScript is the programming language of the web browser and can also be found on web servers, IoT devices, and more.

For this exam, you should be familiar with both the basics of JavaScript and more intermediate concepts. This chapter gives a refresher of the basics. If you are comfortable with the concepts in chapter 1 already, feel free to skip it.

If you find yourself struggling through this chapter, consider starting with the level 1 exam instead of this one. You can find a link to it on the root training page of the dashboard.
