# Ground Control to Major Tom

## Challenge Description

Youâ€™re part of the mission control team, and itâ€™s your job to manage spacecraft systems and communicate with Major Tom during his journey. Implement the required functionality to ensure the mission is a success.

## Requirements

- Connect to Major Tom:

  - When the button with `id="connect"` is clicked:
    - Trigger a fetch request to connect to Major Tom using the API URL from the `getApiUrl()` function.
    - Use the predefined `logMessage` function and pass the string `'connectStart'`.
    - If the fetch response status is `500`, call the `logMessage` function with `'connectFail'`.
    - If the fetch response status is `200`, call the `logMessage` function with `'connectSuccess'`.

- Initiate Launch Sequence:

  - When the button with `id="launch"` is clicked:
    - If no prior successful connection established:
      - Call the `logMessage` function with `'notConnected'`.
    - If connected:
      - Call the `logMessage` function with `'launchStart'`.
      - Perform a countdown (from 3 to 1) every second:
        - Call the `logMessage` function every second during the countdown, passing `'launchCountdown'` as the first argument and the current countdown number as the second.
        - After the countdown, call the `logMessage` function with `'launchSuccess'`.

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: You can use the `setInterval` function to update the timer every second.

- Abort Mission:

  - When the button with `id="abort"` is clicked:
    - If clicked during an active launch countdown:
      - Stop the countdown.
      - Call the `logMessage` function with `'abortSuccess'`.
    - If no countdown is active, call the `logMessage` function with `'abortFail'`.
