# Pokémon Training Camp: Advanced Array Methods Challenge

## Challenge Description

Welcome to the Pokémon Training Camp! As a new trainer, you need to use JavaScript's advanced array methods to manage and nurture your Pokémon team.

Complete all tasks in `/src/main.js` to become the very best Pokémon trainer!

   - Implement the `updatePokedex` function that accepts an array of Pokémon objects.
   - Add a `discoveredAt` property (current timestamp) to each Pokémon.
   - Return the updated Pokémon array.

2. Type Filtering Master:

   - Return an array containing only Pokémon of the specified type.

3. Team Power Assessment:

   - Implement the `calculateTeamPower` function that accepts a Pokémon array.

4. Rare Pokémon Explorer:

   - Implement the `findRarePokemon` function that accepts a Pokémon array.
   - Locate the first Pokémon with a rarity of "Legendary".
   - Return the found Pokémon object, or `undefined` if not found.

5. Evolution Journey:

   - Implement the `evolveAllPokemon` function that accepts a Pokémon array.
   - Increase each Pokémon's level by 1 and power by 10.
