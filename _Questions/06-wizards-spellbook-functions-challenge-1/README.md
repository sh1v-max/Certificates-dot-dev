# Wizard's Spellbook - Functions Challenge

## Challenge Description

As a novice wizard, you've been tasked with creating a magical spellbook. Each spell is represented by a different type of function in JavaScript. Your challenge is to create these spells (functions) and use them to perform various magical tasks.

Complete all tasks in `/src/main.js`.

## Requirements

1. Spell Declaration:
   - Declare a function named `createPotion` that takes three parameters: 
     - `baseIngredient` (default: "water")
     - `catalystIngredient` (default: "moonstone dust")
     - `powerBooster` (default: "dragon breath")
   - The function should return a string describing the potion: "A mystical brew of [baseIngredient], [catalystIngredient], and [powerBooster]!"
   - The definition should be made in the function declaration syntax
   - Use this function in the following ways and log the results:
     - Call it without any arguments
     - Call it with only a base ingredient: "witch hazel"
     - Call it with a base and catalyst: "toadstool extract", "pixie wings"
     - Call it with all three ingredients: "shadow essence", "vampire tears", "phoenix ash"

2. Enchantment Expression:
   - Create a function expression named `castCharm` that takes a target's name as a parameter and returns a charming phrase.
   - The phrase should be in the format: "May luck and fortune smile upon [name]!"
   - The definition should be in the function express syntax
   - Use this function to charm "Elara the Elf" and log the result.

3. Arcane Arrow Function:
   - Create an arrow function named `calculateSpellPower` that takes a wizard's age as a parameter and returns their spell power (age multiplied by 10).
   - The definition should be in the arrow function syntax
   - Use this function to calculate and log the spell power of a 25-year-old wizard.
   ```
   Spell Power: [power]
   ```

4. Spellbook Array:
   - Create an array named `elementalSpells` containing the following spell functions: `castFireball`, `summonWaterSpout`, and `callLightning`.
   - Each function should take a power level parameter and return a string describing the spell's effect. For example:
      ```
      Fireball blazes with power [power]!
      Water spout surges with power [power]!
      Lightning strikes with power [power]!
      ```
   - Use a loop to cast each spell in the array with power levels 1 through 3, and log the results.

5. Magical Condition:
   - Create a function named `determineSpellStrength` that takes a power level as a parameter.
   - Use a conditional statement to return "Weak" if the power is less than 50, "Moderate" if it's between 50 and 100, and "Strong" if it's greater than 100.
   - Test this function with power levels 30, 75, and 150, logging the results.

6. Familiar's Task (Callback Function):
   - Create a function named `transformIngredients` that takes an array of ingredients and a transformation function as parameters.
   - The function should apply the transformation to each ingredient and return a new array with the results.
   - Call this function like so to transform an array of simple ingredients into enchanted ingredients
      ```
      // 
      transformIngredients([
         'newt eyes',
         'toe of frog',
         'wool of bat',
         'tongue of dog'
      ], (ingredient) => `enchanted ${ingredient}`)
      ```
   - Log the result

## What to Expect

Your output should look similar to this:

```
A mystical brew of water, moonstone dust, and dragon breath!
A mystical brew of witch hazel, moonstone dust, and dragon breath!
A mystical brew of toadstool extract, pixie wings, and dragon breath!
A mystical brew of shadow essence, vampire tears, and phoenix ash!
May luck and fortune smile upon Elara the Elf!
Spell Power: 250
Fireball blazes with power 1!
Water spout surges with power 2!
Lightning strikes with power 3!
Weak
Moderate
Strong
(4)Â ['enchanted newt eyes', 'enchanted toe of frog', 'enchanted wool of bat', 'enchanted tongue of dog']
```

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Remember that spells (functions) can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other spells, and stored in magical tomes (arrays). Use loops to repeat actions and conditionals to make decisions based on magical energies (values).
